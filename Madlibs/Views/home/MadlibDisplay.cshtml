    <h1>The Magic Computers</h1>
    <p>Today, every student has a computer small enough to fit into his @Model.Noun. He can solve any
      math problem by simply pushing the computer's little @Model.PluralNoun. Computer can add,
      multiply, divide, and @Model.PresentTenseVerb. They can also @Model.AnotherPresentTenseVerb better than any human.
      Some computers are @Model.PartOfBodyPlural. Others have a/an @Model.Adjective screen that shows all
      kinds of @Model.AnotherPluralNoun and @Model.AnotherAdjective figures.
